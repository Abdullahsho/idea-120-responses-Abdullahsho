*Murray Poem

The lumier Brothers just like Edison created the first mtion picture.
Then came ELIZA processing social cues like that of a computer.
This is the metamorphisis from physical to  digital.
Then the Zork game became the fork in the road.
The art of expressivity is still waiting to expload.
