## Non-Linear Project Idea
For my non-linear project proposal I want to make it an rpg style where you can choose you gear character and abilities. I know this will take sometime but I've been wanting to work on aproject like this for a while but just never got to it so my project will probably very long. My project will be a lot like a movie with lots of gifs and a lot of movement and action rather than like story book one like Crows, Crows, Crows, The Temple of No. I haven't decided on the storylines yet but I want to make at least five with different endings. Although, I'm not sure about the stoyline it will probably have some lore explained before the audience gets into it.

I may do a dungeon type rpg style but I'm not sure yet. My project will mainly serve to be an enjoyabe playthrough movie but without a lot of the playthrough. To make it easier to design I will be using some already existing media such as books as a reference. I also want my project to have a fleshed out world with multiple side characters but no to many. The main setting it will probably takes place will most likely be earth.
