# Everything is ~Gesamtkunstwerk~ Art

Gesamtkunstwerk which means total work of art was a word used to describe a mix of media that encapsulated an audience. <!-- G -->Gesamtkunstwerk in the context of Chris Salter's Entagled was fusing elements of media into an art that would leave the audience in awe.  <!-- E -->This was especially highligtted to be done primarly with a symphony/opera combined with drama/theatre.  <!-- S-->Wagner who coined the term Gesamtkunstwerk alsoencompasses tools used to create the form of media, Wagner for example created a Festspielhaus using modern technology to create a 3D like theatre.  <!-- A -->Wagner also used Gesamtkunstwerk as a way to mix the media of his time much like Rhizome Anthology does. <!-- M -->

 <!-- T -->In the context of the Net Art Anthology Gesamtkunstwerk was mainly any form of internet/computer generated art including code <!-- K -->. <!-- U --> Many people at the time created different forms of media with the rise in technology at the time.  <!-- N-->Gesamtkunstwerk in escence is self expressive and individualistic as the artist is free to create whatever form of media is self expressive to them and the audience will always have an expression whether it be interest, humor,curiosity or confusion <!-- S -->. <!-- T -->This in turn allows any of the digiart to be classified as Gesamtkunstwerk. One I would like to reference is BODIESÂ© INCORPORATED <!-- W -->.  <!--E -->The usage of text based chat rooms and allowing users to customize their own avatars is a display between the interection between the artist and the audience and th emotion derived from it such as interest in the audience creating their own forms of what can be considered art <!-- R -->. <!-- K-->
