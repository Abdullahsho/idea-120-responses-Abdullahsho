![This is an image](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8MjDEuTuRD0/maxresdefault.jpg)
This image when viewed from the medium of Youtube would be an interesting video to click on for a viewer but if it was on instagram as I have seen with similar accounts the vieer would just scroll by it leaving the Instagram page with little to no egagement. When viewed through Youtube the thumbnail can be seen as a lead to some sort of hidden secret information that can entice the viewer but when viewed through instagram it can be seen as just a suttle reference to a popular show. In relation to Barthes rhetorical article the first of three messages the **_linguist message_**, the text in the image above allows the reader to use context clues and knowledge of pop culture to decipher what the image may be referencing so depending on what pint of view it is most likely going to explain what the image may partially be about along with the design of the font. The image itself also relates to the third message laid out by Barthes which was the **_iconic massege_**, in the picture mentioned above it is simple yet not obvious to comprehend what the message of the picture is trying to get to the viewer. Similarly, Barthes also believed the same concept to be true of all advertisements as well as the notion that an everyone must have a different knowledge or view of an image and in the case of the godfather someone may only know of the godfather watch built by jacob & Co to refrence and ponder. Someone else on the other hand may have actually watched the godfather movies and immediately referenced that when they saw the movie or someone may have been a long time viewer of Jake Trans video and thought of a video explainig how mobs/mafia make money, this is also the same as the cultural knowledge that Barthes says is required to read an image. This leads into the third type of message the **_nameable message/aspects_** of an image ad. Aspects that the viewer can name and reference are all derrived from the style/color of the image and person on the image itself thus allowing the reader to grasp at tangibles such as the actor for the godfather or a well of man which both relate to successs.
