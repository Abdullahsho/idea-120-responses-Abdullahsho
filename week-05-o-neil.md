# Weapons Of Mass Destruction Readings

Mathematical weapons of mass destruction, or WMDs, as O'Neil refers to them, are mathematical models or algorithms that claim to quantify important traits such as teacher quality, recidivism risk, and creditworthiness but have damaging consequences and commonly perpetrated inequality, keeping the poor poor and the rich rich.In the beginning of O'neal's WMD she starts off by giving her background in how she worked at a hedge fund as a 'quant',which is a quantitative researcher. I think it is important before beginning the reading because this gives a form of validity somewhat that she has experience in the field she is about to reference or discuss. She then goes on and references how algorithms basically use the faulty idea of correlation equals causations when they shouldn’t be. I found her examples interesting and as I read of how Wysoki a teacher was fired because she did not meet the grading requirements set up by a new algorithm reminded me of an NPR segment I was listening to about how in public schools there's a huge lack of minority teachers in heavily minority communities. The NPR radio segment goes on to include how there are only about 22 percent minority teachers in a 70 percent minority area due to the heavy firing of teachers. This may be the link for the segment or a part of the segment https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2016/10/07/496717541/study-finds-students-of-all-races-prefer-teachers-of-color. 

In the second half O’Neil goes into detail and describes how mathematical data can be used to create advantageous situations such as the Cleveland Indians analyzing data to reorganize their team and increase performance.She then goes on to liken a deceptive or unexpected algorithm that is widely used as as dangerous as a bomb. This in my opinion clearly describes and highlights the problem with data sets and puts it to a problem of the variable data not being highlighted. O'Neil then compares damaging algorithms to weapons of mass devastation because of how they deteriorate and destroy all areas of life they are used on by miscalculating them incorrectly in a way by being nuanced and not reflecting certain data. This is further emphasized by O’Neal arguing how feedback loops create toxicity when she referenced poor individuals and racial minorities are disproportionately represented in recidivism models like the LSI-R (Level of Service Inventory-Revised). They inquire about past encounters with the police and this is more probable for Black and Latino kids, who are frequently targeted by police forces through stop and frisk programs. They also look to see whether any of one's acquaintances or family members have criminal history, which is statistically more common in low-income areas.

O’Neal then ends with discussing how predictive police software is unable to forecast white-collar crime, despite the fact that the crimes committed by the wealthy in the early 2000s undoubtedly resulted in some of the most extensive crime in recent US history. Predictive policing data is being used by police departments around the country to enforce zero-tolerance policies for both violent and nonviolent offenses. They concentrate nearly entirely on the poor, indicating that they have a choice in where they spend their efforts. This goes back to what O’Neal referenced in the negative feedback loop and how it causes more damage like that of a bomb.
