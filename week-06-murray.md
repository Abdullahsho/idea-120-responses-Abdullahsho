In my opinion Murray's predictions about internet television and inhabiting virtual environments were successful. Some things Murray predictedthat came true were that everyone will be able to create webpages and web art came true through the use of sites like Sopify, Godady and Woocommerce make it smooth and easy for anyone without prior knowledge of web building to create a websie easily. Then when Murray talks about the web being an nterconnected web of opinions and art they were also correct as people push their own opinions through the mediums of Youtube and twitter. Even in the case of television other sources are slowly taking over News giants such as MSNBC and CNN, it may not have chznged to much but is slowly tranforming over time. In terms of virtual environmrnts such as those which The Mandalorian a great seriese uses, Murray was absoluely on point in the use of video games to format hyperealistic 3D landscapes. But in regards to us actaully playing roles we are not yet to that level of technology but we are slowly progressing throught he ueses of Netflixes interactive movies were yu get to choose your story path such as in minecraft story mode. Murray discusses how how reality will be molded into vrtual. In the Mandalorean for eample the Sony technology to mold the cinematic environment is both seen and felt by the actors to actually almost realistic environemnts while viwers can only see the actors and virtual sets alowing viewrs to experience an almost seemless, realistic and amazing tv show.
