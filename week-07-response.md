## James Birdle Response
James starts of by describing his own experience with the internet before he goes into detail about the effect the internet has on young children and this is imporant becuse he states that the internet in some ways shapped and molded his childhood which it has done for 70 percent of people. He hen goes into more detail on the different uses of internet and how parents let their kids watch peppa pig for example to have a break. But where he draws the line is at where billions of kids are consuming a giant amount of this content and how powerful algorithms are at targetting kids exactly. I agree with James that there has been an increasingly symbiotic relationship between younger children and YouTube. My little sister is also very obsessed with Youtube and regrding the kinder egg videos my sister bought about ten kinder eggs the whole kinder eggs craze was going on. Even when I was working at amazon I probably packed over a hundred kinder eggs, no joke. a

James then goes on to discuss the weird process of automated, reused content, being replicated at mass scale and this reminds me of this video I watched a while back https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LuIC2w725c. He then states that big corporations like Google, Youtube and any other companies like them should take responsibility for the content on their platform which he knows is almost impossible because hundreds of millions of hours and videos get uploaded everyday along with other content. James then proposes the idea of shutting the platforms down entirely, which I whole heartedly disagree with. The first thing is, that it is not the corporations fault that the content is being uploaded even if they try to make algorithms to moderate it there will always be some bad content that slips through the cracks. Secondly, who is going to be given the power to shut them down? Is that even just and what will the iplications be? As even today in America we still have many cases of politicle corruption s the government definetely can't be given that power and even if they did have it would totally go over American values on freedom. Lastly, it will always be difficult to moderate the content because just as there are millons of people in the world good and bad there are billions of the people wiloing to put bad content and good content it is up t us as a society to choose what is allowwable and acceptable. The way to do this is to vote with your dollars and impressions, don't listen to music promoting things yu don't support and unfollow pages on social media.
