## O'Neil and Chalabi Response
In her Ted video Chalabi discusses how data can be manipulated and how most people don't trust data. It is for this reason that I am also subject to not trusting data/statistics as I became aware that they can become manipulated. It may be for this reason that other people don't trust data, understand it or even want to remove data and statistics all together. I'm confident that if your on the internet even for a little while you will be subject to data/statistics. Even if you aren't on the internet you will still be subject to data.

As someone who has used Facebook, Google, Pinterest and Yutube ads it is essentail for businessses to have the ability to track users as that allows them to find the best purchasers. This is imprtant for businesses to thrive otherwise they won't be able to make sales. What the pixels/data do is create profiles of users based on other users and available data to create profiles of the best user to purchase. Some people have said that it forces you to make a purchase through thee targeted ads when it really doesn't. People can choose to purchase or not. Most online businesses use targeted ads because it's much better than direct to consumer as with direct to consumer as many businesses usually brea even and this is why most online businesses break even but with targeted ads, the ads are automated and perform better and better each time regardless of if a sale is amde or not. The world would not be the same as the motivation for most brands and companies wouldn't be there without the cycle of online targeted ads.
