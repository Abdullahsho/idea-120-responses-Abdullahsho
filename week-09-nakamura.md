## Response To Nakamura
In the article Lisa Nakamura discusses how technologies such as e-mail and instant messaging gave way to more graphically intensive media forms in the 1990s. These media platforms uncover and display people's racial, ethnic, and gender identities. This combined with the idea of neoliberalism avoiding the idea of race altogether became popular among people. This allowed the internet to become a large defacto mesh net work, as you put it in class, to become universally used. The concepts of colorblindness was echoed by this which is in itself problematic.

I believe Nakamura's citation of Lev Manovich saying "interactive media ask us to identify with someone elseâ€™s mental structure", is that there is always an implicit risk in becoming habituated to communication with a given medium and internalizing its limitations. For example on Facebook, users who are interested in a certain politicle party will join Facebook groups based on that, this then allows the Facebook algorith to search for and find ideas and groups similar to that because they would be more likely to engage with that form of content rather than new ideas and ideologies. This then makes them programmed to believe and parrot the ideas of the groups he is in. The outcome of these platforms ruining the cognitive ability for someoen to go out of their own way of thinking and attept to be objective is reflective of big companies such as Facebook as being profit driven.
