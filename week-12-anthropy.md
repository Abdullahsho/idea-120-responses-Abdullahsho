## Anna Anthropy Response
In the begginning of the chapter Anna highlights some issues some people may have with video games such as it spuring children to be violent and some thing she didn't mention but I would also like to add is that some people are upset with games that are hard or allow multiplay or co-op. She also states that the specific issue she has with video games is that they are not inclusive as they don't include queer people or lgbtq people. For reference according to diamondlobby.com, "79.2% of main protagonists in games are male, 20.8% female. 54.2% of main characters in games are white. Just 8.3% of main characters in games are females of non-white ethnicities". This shows that there is some validity as this being a legitamte issue at least. Then she ges on to say that most games are men shooting other men and there are few games where the main protagomist is a women and she plays roles as a servent serving food for men and playing dressup/weddings. When Anna says "a women protagonist put in another role other than slaughterer put in a role of servitude" is a little over blown but it is very understandble where she is coing from.

In the second chapter Anna discusses the orgin of video games and how they where made. She states that the creation of video games where dominated by white men in the 1960s and 1970s. I agree with this because even Bill Gates one of the wealthiest billionare on earth who specifically owns an IT company said that if he did't have access to computers at the exact tme he did he would never have come up with microsoft and at the time in 1960s-1970s there where only a few places with computers and he was lucky enough to have access to one and I also think that someone calculated the percentage of BIll Gates creating microsoft the time he did as less than 1% if I remeber correctly.

In the begiining of the second chapter one of the headlines is the history of magic where she describes the early digital game designers as engineers who created games that mirrored their backgrounds and hobbies, such as Dungeons & Dragons. Anna then highlights Jeff Howard's understanding into the "connection between programming and the verbal grammar of magic" in  early digital games like Zork and Spellbreaker. In reference to the  headline "the history of magic" Anna references that both wizards and programmers can change the reality of their games, which is a fascinating analogy. However, Anna portrays magic as a metaphor for game design in the rest of the chapter, which covers the history of the video game industry's corporatization. When non-creators begin to exercise creative control over video game material. These big corporations push less and less diverisity by not taking risks to create or promote games starring diverese characters.

In regards to a larger number of voices participating in media, being honest, before I didn't care or see the reason for more diversity because I felt that there was a narrative trying to be pushed and that it would downgrade the art works and mediums being translated. But overime I've changed my mind and I've began to see the exclusion of certain voices going into a deeper systemic problem in a fields and mediums. The inclusion of diversity in differnt mediums makes it better for example the miles morales into the spiderverse movie was one of the most colorful, creative and entertaining animated movies of all time and it starred a black and latin protaganinst. There are countless other mediums such as Fresh Prince, Black Panther, Falcon And Winter Soldier and so much more. I mainly picked the ones with characters I could relate too but the point is that yo can find different ways or methods of creating these mediums and it can help you improve on the next medium you create.
