## Anna Anthropy Ch3-4 Response
In chapter three Anna details storytelling and "exploring dynamics, relationships, and systems" are particularly well-suited to video games. Anna believes that all games, including so-called "folk games" like tag or chess, explore and express a wide range of systems and interactions. Video games can operate as a teacher, guiding the player in the proper direction while allowing her to experience the story in her own way, thanks to their sometimes-hidden and frequently intricate rules and details. According to Anna she believes and lists reasons of how video games are complex in how they guid the audience to a goal but they at the same time allow the user freedom such as to chose their own choices which will inevitably lead them to where the game wans them to go.

In chapter four Anna gives a rundown of mods, hacks, engines, and level editors to demonstrate the various ways that "people like you are reclaiming an art form," in the hopes that her readers will be inspired to start customizing their games. Anna's moves from mods to hacks to game engines and level editors which are are difficult for someone as unexperienced as me to follow in this chapter. Anna then says on the other hand, provides a detailed review of each genre (along with noteworthy examples) in each topic. Mods and hacks can be used to vandalize, reinvent, and/or subvert a game, as well as provide insight into the original game or remedy an issue that the modder finds. This chapter explores the customization and freedom to customize games. 

Some questions I had about these two chapters was what were level editors,game engines and how they work in their complexity in regards to games and their creations generally. What I learned from these chaptera was that level editors motivate players to become designers, while game engines allow developers to avoid starting from scratch, making the process of building a game considerably easier and less expensive. Because she sees the technical barrier to videogame creation as limiting the medium's diversity.This is also a reason that Anna Anthropy favors methods like this that make it accessible to people with minimal technical knowledge like me. This technology also reminded me of shopify and how anyone with minimal knowledge could start up an e-commerce busines without having any knowledge on coding and this displays the use of technology allowing a diverrse amount of people to run their own unique business similar to creating one's own unique game just as Anna Anthropy discusses as an issue.
